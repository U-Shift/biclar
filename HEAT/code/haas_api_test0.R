# HEAT API tests

# ucc_
# The UI collects "scenario" details (aka use case criteria) (incl. geographic location, selected modes of transport,
# type of assessment, etc.). These UI inputs are prefixed with ucc_ (for use case criteria).
# In the UI all validity checks and warnings are carried out - here and only here at the present moment
# (incl. maximum levels of active travel, minimum population size, etc.)


# webapp_inputs - this is a RDS file which should be downloaded from the "Export page" of the UI.
# It stores UI inputs with values. The values of this can be modified before they are sent to the API.
# Please modify these with great care. Since the business logic is not a part of the model itself,
# improper combination or values of variables (inputs) won't be detected, resulting in incorrect results.
# The general rule is that any ucc_ UI inputs should not be modified manually
# (since these shape the UI pages and the layout of input fields, and the corresponding collection of UI
# inputs with values and the data structures used by the model). Any other values of inputs can be changed 
# - such as numeric values. Still, constraints which are available in the UI (as warnings or errors)
# should be respected to get reliable results from the model. Note that webapp_inputs as RDS has to
# be downloaded from the UI corresponding to the model version used (at the present moment only heat_5_0 is available).
# Please use "Inspect" tool in the web browser to get the names of the inputs.
