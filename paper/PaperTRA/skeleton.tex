\section{Introduction}\label{sec1}}

The Introduction section, of referenced text \citet{bib1} expands on the
background of the work (some overlap with the Abstract is acceptable).
The introduction should not include subheadings.

Springer Nature does not impose a strict layout as standard however
authors are advised to check the individual requirements for the journal
they are planning to submit to as there may be journal-level
preferences. When preparing your text please also be aware that some
stylistic choices are not supported in full text XML (publication
version), including coloured font. These will not be replicated in the
typeset article if it is accepted.

\section{Equations}\label{sec4}}

Equations in \LaTeX~can either be inline or on-a-line by itself
(``display equations''). For inline equations use the \texttt{\$...\$}
commands. E.g.: The equation \(H\psi = E \psi\) is written via the
command \texttt{\$H\ \textbackslash{}psi\ =\ E\ \textbackslash{}psi\$}.

For display equations (with auto generated equation numbers) one can use
the equation or align environments:

\begin{equation}
\|\tilde{X}(k)\|^2 \leq\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{p}\left\|\tilde{Y}_i(k)\right\|^2+\sum\limits_{j=1}^{q}\left\|\tilde{Z}_j(k)\right\|^2 }{p+q}.\label{eq1}
\end{equation}

where, \begin{align}
D_\mu &=  \partial_\mu - ig \frac{\lambda^a}{2} A^a_\mu \nonumber \\
F^a_{\mu\nu} &= \partial_\mu A^a_\nu - \partial_\nu A^a_\mu + g f^{abc} A^b_\mu A^a_\nu \label{eq2}
\end{align}

Notice the use of \texttt{\textbackslash{}nonumber} in the align
environment at the end of each line, except the last, so as not to
produce equation numbers on lines where no equation numbers are
required. The \texttt{\textbackslash{}label\{\}} command should only be
used at the last line of an align environment where
\texttt{\textbackslash{}nonumber} is not used.

\begin{equation}
Y_\infty = \left( \frac{m}{\textrm{GeV}} \right)^{-3}
    \left[ 1 + \frac{3 \ln(m/\textrm{GeV})}{15}
    + \frac{\ln(c_2/5)}{15} \right]
\end{equation}

The class file also supports the use of
\texttt{\textbackslash{}mathbb\{\}},
\texttt{\textbackslash{}mathscr\{\}} and
\texttt{\textbackslash{}mathcal\{\}} commands. As such
\texttt{\textbackslash{}mathbb\{R\}},
\texttt{\textbackslash{}mathscr\{R\}} and
\texttt{\textbackslash{}mathcal\{R\}} produces \(\mathbb{R}\),
\(\mathscr{R}\) and \(\mathcal{R}\) respectively (refer
Subsubsection~\ref{subsubsec2}).

\hypertarget{sec5}{%
\section{Tables}\label{sec5}}

Tables can be inserted via the normal \texttt{knitr::kable()} function
or other table-generating packages.

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tab:tab1}Caption text}
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{r|r}
\hline
temperature & pressure\\
\hline
0 & 0.0002\\
\hline
20 & 0.0012\\
\hline
40 & 0.0060\\
\hline
60 & 0.0300\\
\hline
80 & 0.0900\\
\hline
100 & 0.2700\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Tables can also be inserted via the normal table and tabular
environment. To put footnotes inside tables you should use
\texttt{\textbackslash{}footnotetext{[}{]}\{...\}} tag. The footnote
appears just below the table itself (refer
Tables\textasciitilde{}\ref{tab1} and \ref{tab2}). For the corresponding
footnotemark use \texttt{\textbackslash{}footnotemark{[}...{]}}

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Caption text}\label{tab1}%
\begin{tabular}{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
Column 1 & Column 2  & Column 3 & Column 4\\
\midrule
row 1    & data 1   & data 2  & data 3  \\
row 2    & data 4   & data 5\footnotemark[1]  & data 6  \\

\footnotetext[1]{Example for a first table footnote. This is an example of table footnote.}
\footnotetext[2]{Example for a second table footnote. This is an example of table footnote.}
\end{table}

\noindent The input format for the above table is as follows:

\begin{verbatim}

\vfill\eject

In case of double column layout, tables which do not fit in single
column width should be set to full text width. For this, you need to use
\texttt{\textbackslash{}begin\{table*\}} \texttt{...}
\texttt{\textbackslash{}end\{table*\}} instead of
\texttt{\textbackslash{}begin\{table\}} \texttt{...}
\texttt{\textbackslash{}end\{table\}} environment. Lengthy tables which
do not fit in textwidth should be set as rotated table. For this, you
need to use \texttt{\textbackslash{}begin\{sidewaystable\}} \texttt{...}
\texttt{\textbackslash{}end\{sidewaystable\}} instead of
\texttt{\textbackslash{}begin\{table*\}} \texttt{...}
\texttt{\textbackslash{}end\{table*\}} environment. This environment
puts tables rotated to single column width. For tables rotated to double
column width, use \texttt{\textbackslash{}begin\{sidewaystable*\}}
\texttt{...} \texttt{\textbackslash{}end\{sidewaystable*\}}.

\begin{sidewaystable}
\caption{Tables which are too long to fit, should be written using the "sidewaystable" environment as shown here}\label{tab3}

\section{Figures}\label{sec6}}

As per the \LaTeX~standards you need to use eps images for
\LaTeX~compilation and \texttt{pdf/jpg/png} images for \texttt{PDFLaTeX}
compilation. Use the \texttt{dev} knitr option to use the approrpate
format. This is one of the major difference between \LaTeX~and
\texttt{PDFLaTeX}. Each image should be from a single input .eps/vector
image file. Avoid using subfigures. The command for inserting images for
\LaTeX~and \texttt{PDFLaTeX} can be generalized. The package used to
insert images in \texttt{LaTeX/PDFLaTeX} is the graphicx package.
Figures can be inserted via the normal figure environment as shown in
the below example:

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{skeleton_files/figure-latex/fig1-1} \caption{This is an example of a caption}\label{fig:fig1}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{sec7}{%
\section{Algorithms, Program codes and Listings}\label{sec7}}

Packages \texttt{algorithm}, \texttt{algorithmicx} and
\texttt{algpseudocode} are used for setting algorithms in \LaTeX~using
the format:

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{<alg-caption>}\label{<alg-label>}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
. . .
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
\end{verbatim}

You may refer above listed package documentations for more details
before setting \texttt{algorithm} environment. For program codes, the
``program'' package is required and the command to be used is
\texttt{\textbackslash{}begin\{program\}} \texttt{...}
\texttt{\textbackslash{}end\{program\}}. A fast exponentiation
procedure:

Similarly, for \texttt{listings}, use the \texttt{listings} package.
\texttt{\textbackslash{}begin\{lstlisting\}} \texttt{...}
\texttt{\textbackslash{}end\{lstlisting\}} is used to set environments
similar to \texttt{verbatim} environment. Refer to the
\texttt{lstlisting} package documentation for more details.

A fast exponentiation procedure:

\lstset{texcl=true,basicstyle=\small\sf,commentstyle=\small\rm,mathescape=true,escapeinside={(*}{*)}}
\begin{lstlisting}
begin
  for $i:=1$ to $10$ step $1$ do
      expt($2,i$);

where
proc expt($x,n$) $\equiv$
  $z:=1$;
  do if $n=0$ then exit fi;
     do if odd($n$) then exit fi;                 
        comment: (*\textrm{This is a comment statement;}*)
        $n:=n/2$; $x:=x*x$ od;
     { $n>0$ };
     $n:=n-1$; $z:=z*x$ od;
  print($z$). 
end
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Cross referencing}\label{sec8}}

Figures and tables are labeled with a prefix (fig or tab, respectively)
plus the chunk label. Other environments such as equation and align can
be labelled via the \texttt{\textbackslash{}label\{\#label\}} command
inside or just below the \texttt{\textbackslash{}caption\{\}} command.
You can then use the label for cross-reference. As an example, consider
the chunk label declared for Figure~\ref{fig:fig1} which is fig1. To
cross-reference it, use the command
\texttt{Figure\ \textbackslash{}ref\{fig:fig1\}}, for which it comes up
as ``Figure~\ref{fig:fig1}''.

To reference line numbers in an algorithm, consider the label declared
for the line number 2 of Algorithm~\ref{algo1} is
\texttt{\textbackslash{}label\{algln2\}}. To cross-reference it, use the
command \texttt{\textbackslash{}ref\{algln2\}} for which it comes up as
line~\ref{algln2} of Algorithm~\ref{algo1}.

\section{Section title of first appendix}\label{secA1}}

An appendix contains supplementary information that is not an essential
part of the text itself but which may be helpful in providing a more
comprehensive understanding of the research problem or it is information
that is too cumbersome to be included in the body of the paper.

For submissions to Nature Portfolio Journals please use the heading
``Extended Data''.
